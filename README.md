# Delta robot

This repository documents a small project I am currently working on during semester break. I want to create a 3D printed 3-DOF delta robot and implement a computer program that uses inverse kinematics to move the end effector to a specific position in 3D space. 

Dieses Projekt ist noch in Arbeit! have just started.


The end-result will look something like this:
